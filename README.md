# Gradient-Descent-Implentation
The algorithm operates by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in a manner that systematically descends towards the minimum of the objective function. It accomplishes this by leveraging the concept of gradients, which represent the steepness and direction of change of the objective function with respect to each parameter.

It's important to note that gradient descent can potentially converge to a local minimum of the objective function, rather than the global minimum, depending on the function's shape and the algorithm's initialization. Consequently, researchers and practitioners need to exercise caution, employing strategies such as different initializations, adaptive learning rates, or advanced optimization techniques to mitigate the risk of suboptimal solutions.

Overall, gradient descent is a powerful and widely used algorithm in the field of machine learning, facilitating the optimization of models by iteratively adjusting parameters based on the calculated gradients of the objective function. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to navigate the parameter space towards regions associated with lower objective function values, thus improving the model's overall performance.
